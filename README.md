# AYip VContainer Extensions
This package will be in ongoing development.

## How to Use
### Scene Validator
It validates the lifetime scopes and game objects in Editor to save your time from testing the registry during runtime.
- Validate the registrations
- Identify which gameObjects in the scene are not assigned to the auto-injected gameObjects List

Manual: `Unity's toolbar > Tools > VContainer > "Choose your option"`

Hotkeys:
1. Press `Alt(option) + Shift + V` to validate the scene
2. Press `Alt(option) + Shift + C` to validate and play the editor.
